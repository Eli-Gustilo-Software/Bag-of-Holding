# Bag-of-Holding

The Bag of Holding provides a quick and easy way to keep track of DnD, or other roll playing games, player character's items and gear. It utilizes my Hermez Library to allow the user to send items to their nearby friends on either Android of Apple phones. Meant to allow players to focus on the game and not inventory management while allowing for a video game-esque level of inventory management such as allow items to be given names, effects, long winded descriptions, pictures, and much more is planned.
