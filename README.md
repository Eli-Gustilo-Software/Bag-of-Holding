# Bag-of-Holding

The Bag of Holding provides a quick and easy way to keep track of D&D, or other roll playing games, player character's items and gear.

 Utilizes my Hermez Library to allow the user to send items via NSD/Bonjour to their friends on either Android or Apple devices.

 Allow players to focus on the game they are playing while allowing for an easy video game-esque level of inventory management. Your items can be given names, fancy effects, long winded descriptions, their own picture, be copied, deleted, modified, transferred,  and so much more is in the works.
